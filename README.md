### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently in the final year of my master's degree in Telecommunications and Informatics Engineering working on my master's thesis, which focuses on vehicular networks (VANETS) and, more specifically, on finding an innovative solution for virtual traffic lights using the fog computing paradigm. The main objective of this dissertation is to design a system capable of significantly improving traffic efficiency, decreasing emissions and increasing road safety by taking advantage of V2X communications.
